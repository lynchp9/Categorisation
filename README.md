# Categorisation
Use various algorithms to categorize data from data from the data pre-processing step
#1 - Logistic Regression
#2 - K Nearest Neighbours
#3 - Support Vector Machine
#4 - Naive Bayes
#5 - Random Forest

Then the confusion matrix, precsion, recall, and f1 score for anaysis of the effectiveness of the algorithms
